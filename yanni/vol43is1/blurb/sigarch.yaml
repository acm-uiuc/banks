blurb: |
  SIGARCH at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign is a student-run group dedicated to exploring all things computer architecture — from processors and memory hierarchies to emerging trends in hardware design. We bring together students passionate about understanding and building computing systems through weekly discussions, paper reviews, and hands-on workshops. Whether you're diving into your first architecture project or already designing custom chips, SIGARCH provides a collaborative space to learn, share ideas, and grow alongside others who love hardware.
