We bring together students passionate about understanding and building computing systems through weekly discussions, paper reviews, and hands-on workshops. Whether you're diving into your first architecture project or already designing custom chips, SIGARCH provides a collaborative space to learn, share ideas, and grow alongside others who love hardware.",
