  "blurb": "Ever wondered how AI actually works - or better yet, how to make it work? That’s what we do at AIDA. We explore the world of artificial intelligence and data analytics through hands-on projects, workshops, and demos that turn abstract concepts into real results.\n\nOur beginner track, MLScope, walks you through the fundamentals of AI and machine learning with guided sessions and practical mini-projects - from predicting housing prices to analyzing massive textual datasets with large language models. For those ready to level up, our project track dives into real-world AI applications. This semester’s lineup includes six active projects, covering everything from sustainable recycling assistants to financial reasoning and sports analytics.\n\nWhether you’re brand new to AI or already training deep learning models in your sleep, AIDA’s got something for you. Come learn, build, and collaborate with a group of curious minds who think data is cool (because it is).\n\nMondays at 6. Be there :D",
