  This semester, SIGecom has been diving deep into the intersection of computer science and economics. Each week, we’ve presented on topics ranging from algorithmic trading and optional membership design to game theory in AI, dynamic pricing, and platform economics—exploring how algorithms shape the markets and digital platforms we interact with every day.
  
  Beyond presentations, we’re shifting toward hands-on experimentation. We’ve kicked off two new projects: one focused on developing a program tailored for simulating prediction markets, and another centered around building an algorithmic trading system. These initiatives give members the chance to explore how data, modeling, and automation can come together to simulate and influence real-world markets.
  
  A highlight this semester is Traydner, developed by Evan Doubek. Traydner is a learn-by-doing trading simulator where users can practice trading stocks, crypto, and forex using a risk-free paper wallet. It’s an exciting way for members to experiment with strategy and market behavior without financial risk.
  
  At SIGecom, our goal is simple: to get people’s hands dirty with real projects—no experience required. Whether you’re an economist curious about coding or a CS student fascinated by markets, everyone is welcome to join and learn by building.
