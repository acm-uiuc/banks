So far, we’ve already hosted our semesterly game jam and workshops on Blender and Shaders, and are planning ahead for future workshops and our industry panel.

In terms of semester projects, our members have been hard at work, and we’re happy to say that the games are starting to take flight! We feel that our games will truly be on an island of their own in terms of quality and are hard at work on the Unity files to try to make these ideas come to life! We’re hoping to release the list of finished games ASAP for our final showcase for the semester.
