It’s that time of the year again: Qiskit Fall Fest is upon us! Qiskit Fall Fest is an IBM Quantum-sponsored month-long collection of quantum-related events. SIGQuantum kicked off our second ever Qiskit Fall Fest last Wednesday (October 15th) with an amazing talk on “Quantum Error Correction and Information Theory” by Sujeet Bhalerao. We had pizza, stickers, and quantum, what else could a quantum enthusiast dream to ask for? A whole *month* of quantum computing talks and Qiskit workshops? Turns out the answer is a resounding yes! 

Throughout the next month, we will have a series of fascinating talks and events related to quantum computing and Qiskit (a coding language for quantum computers), culminating with an Open Source Quantum Hackathon. We invite all of you to join us to learn about quantum computing from a variety of perspectives at our upcoming events! All are welcome, regardless of background! 

The past and upcoming events are summarized in the flier on the next page. We are still trying to figure out some final details, so keep up to date by joining the SIGQuantum Discord server. We would like to highlight a few events in particular:
1. IBM Speaker on Advanced Qiskit (date TBD, likely around November 9th) - We will be hosting a spectacular speaker from **IBM** to walk us through some advanced Qiskit programming. Do you want to learn how to code a quantum computer? If so, this event is for you! (We strongly encourage all to attend the Beginner Qiskit and Intermediate Qiskit sessions before this.)
2. Undergraduate Lightning Talks (date TBD, likely around November 9th) - A number of undergraduates are going to give short talks on subjects in quantum computing they find interesting. We invite all of you to come support these undergraduates! If you’re an undergraduate interested in presenting (on literally anything related to quantum computing), please reach out to SIGQuantum exec on our Discord. 
3. Open Source Quantum Hackathon (November 15th - 17th) - Join us for the final event of Qiskit Fall Fest on November 15th! This is a chill kind of Hackathon. We’re going to split into groups and choose something open source and quantum-related, for example, the Qiskit coding language itself, to contribute to. This will be a great opportunity to learn something new and show off your skills in time for our hackathon trip next semester!

If you have any questions about these events or would like to sign up to give a lightning talk, please reach out to us on Discord (@academicweapona or on the SIGQuantum Discord server). 

As a reminder, everyone is welcome, regardless of background. Did you just hear about quantum computers for the first time and want to find out what all the buzz is about? Come to Qiskit Fall Fest! Have you been messing around in quantum computing theory or hardware and realize you need to learn some software? Come to Qiskit Fall Fest! Do you think all of this quantum computing buzz is bullshit? That’s okay, come to Qiskit Fall Fest!

We look forward to seeing all of you at our events. Here’s to an amazing second run of Qiskit Fall Fest!
