College sophomore Amy Chen stumbled upon a revolutionary technique for writing better essays: actually reading the assigned material before writing about it. The discovery has shocked her professors and classmates alike.

"I used to just skim the first paragraph and make assumptions," Chen explained. "But this semester I tried reading the whole thing. My grades went from C's to A's almost immediately." Chen's professor, Dr. Robert Collins, confirmed her improved performance. "I was stunned. She actually quoted the text accurately. I almost cried."

Other students are skeptical of Chen's method. "That sounds like way too much work," said classmate Jake Morrison. "I'll stick with my current system of reading SparkNotes ten minutes before class."

Chen plans to share her discovery with others, though she's not optimistic about adoption rates. "People say they'll try it, but then they see how many pages they have to read and immediately give up," she noted.
