# Banks Generator v1
This BotB issue is generated with a very janky set of Python scripts that generates latex.

## Directories and Files
- `/content`:  All files in this directory are generated by the scripts. Do not modify them
- `/articles`: Articles in markdown format should be placed here. They should have the format:
```md
title: article_title
authors: ['author1', 'author2']

lorem ipsum
```
- `/articles/images`: Images for the articles. E.g. `/articles/images` contains `icpc.png`, and is referenced in MD as `![icpc](icpc.jpg)`
- `/blurb`: Contains yaml files that detail per-SIG/Committee information that cannot be obtained via ACM Core. This information is combined with ACM Core organisational info to create the JSON files in `/content/blurb`
- `/main.tex`: Template where the generated .tex files in `/content` are inserted
- `/config.yaml`: Specifies volume number, issue number, letter from the chair article, article order, and SIG/Committee order
- `/horoscope.yaml`: Horoscope. Format:
```yaml
horoscope:
  - author: 
  - question: How are you holding up this semester?
    response:
      - {One entry per Zodiac sign}
```
- `/events.yaml`: Upcoming events. Format:

```yaml
events:
  - name: "Weekly Social Hour"
    date: "Every Friday"
    time: "5:00 PM - 6:00 PM"
    location: "Legends"
  ...
```
