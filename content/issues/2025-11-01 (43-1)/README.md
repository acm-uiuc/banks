# Banks Generator v1
This BotB issue is generated with a very janky set of Python scripts that generates latex to be compiled. The code is remarkably terrible; this is because it was built by me (Yanni) and Claude. This hopefully will be last issue of Banks that uses this system. It is rather difficult to do content-aware typesetting (i.e. something beyond just the multicol environment), and thus, we hope build a more customisable meta-typesetter in something like Typst for better versatility.

## Internal Workings
1. Generate articles (./articles/\*.md &rarr; ./content/articles/\*.yaml)
2. Generate blurbs (./blurb/\*.yaml + Core API Organisation Info &rarr; ./content/articles/\*.yaml)
3. Convert article yaml files into a single LaTeX file. 
    * Replace all markdown formatting with placeholder values
    * Escape characters that are protected in LaTeX
    * Replace placeholder values with LaTeX intristics 
        * `<br>` &rarr; `\vspace{}`
        * `###` &rarr; `\subsubsection`
        * `##` &rarr; `\subsection`
        * `#` &rarr; `\section`
        * `**text**` &rarr; `\textbf{}`
        * `*text*` &rarr; `\textit{}`
        * `![test](image)` &rarr; `\begin{center}\includegraphics`
        * `[test](image)` &rarr; `\qrcode{link}link`
        * `* list` &rarr; `\begin{itemize}\item`
4. Generate TOC LaTeX file
5. Generate Events LaTeX file
6. Generate Letter from the Chair LaTeX file
7. Generate Directory LaTeX file
8. Compile 
    * First Pass: Compile everything
    * Second Pass: Get page numbers for articles and populate TOC


## Directories and Files
- `/content`:  All files in this directory are generated by the scripts. Do not modify them
- `/articles`: Articles in markdown format should be placed here. They should have the format:
```md
title: article_title
authors: ['author1', 'author2']

lorem ipsum
```
- `/articles/images`: Images for the articles. E.g. `/articles/images` contains `icpc.png`, and is referenced in MD as `![icpc](icpc.jpg)`
- `/blurb`: Contains yaml files that detail per-SIG/Committee information that cannot be obtained via ACM Core. This information is combined with ACM Core organisational info to create the JSON files in `/content/blurb`
- `/main.tex`: Template where the generated .tex files in `/content` are inserted
- `/config.yaml`: Specifies volume number, issue number, letter from the chair article, article order, and SIG/Committee order
- `/horoscope.yaml`: Horoscope. Format:
```yaml
horoscope:
  - author: 
  - question: How are you holding up this semester?
    response:
      - {One entry per Zodiac sign}
```s
- `/events.yaml`: Upcoming events. Format:
```yaml
events:
  - name: "Weekly Social Hour"
    date: "Every Friday"
    time: "5:00 PM - 6:00 PM"
    location: "Legends"
  ...
```
