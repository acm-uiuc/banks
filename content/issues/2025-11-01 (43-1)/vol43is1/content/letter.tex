\byline{\textbf{\Large Letter from the Chair}}{Jacob Levine}

First, I'd like to thank Yanni, Minh, and Krish for all of the effort they put into bringing back Banks for the first time since the pandemic and for the first time in print form in over a decade. ACM has greatly expanded since the last edition, making banks' mission all the more important: with over 42 hours per week of activities between all of our SIGs, committees, and events, it's nearly impossible for anyone to fully follow all of what's going on at ACM.

I'd also like to congratulate Cole and Shreenija on running a successful R\textbar{}P 2025. R\textbar{}P brought in a notably diverse set of speakers, and their career fair brought a wide array of companies to Siebel including OpenAI, Jane Street, and Qualcomm. Thank you to everyone who helped make this event a success. Additionally, I'd like to congratulate Cameron, Minh, and Emma for bringing in over 125 teams for Fall CTF and Adya and Akshay for running the broadest corporate talks series in over 5 years.

Getting involved is the key to assuring ACM’s help in pursuing your own interests. Feel free to stop by our office and talk to us, or you can email T4 at officers@acm.illinois.edu. I look forward to everything we do for the rest of this semester.
