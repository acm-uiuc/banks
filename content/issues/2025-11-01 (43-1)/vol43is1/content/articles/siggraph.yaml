  Update from SIGGraph!

  SIGGRAPH is having a great semester! We have had a handful of hands-on workshops in a wide range of topics including raytracing, Gaussian splatting, Cel shading, and Cellular Automata. Accompanying a few slides explaining the topic, we supply a Shadertoy project for every member to either mess around with or iterate on what we talked about in the workshop. At the end of each meeting, members show off what they created to the rest of the club in an interactive environment. Throughout the semester we will continue to host these workshops while also making space for project meetings.
  
  We have started development on a spatial audio visualizer using an AR headset and a unified backend abstraction for both OpenGL and Vulkan APIs to make interfacing with them easier for any future SIGGRAPH projects. The spatial audio visualizer project presents a lot of unique challenges to it including triangulating audio to find the source, decomposing audio signals based on distances, and needing to utilize machine learning to classify noise. The backend project is unique because an abstraction from these rendering APIs is not commonly done, and when it is, it is not typically publicly accessible. This means a lot of meaningful design decisions are being made daily and every contributor is learning about many technical aspects of creating computer graphics from scratch.
  
  We meet every Sunday at 2PM! Join our Discord (find it at https://www.acm.illinois.edu/) for more information because we would love to have you!
