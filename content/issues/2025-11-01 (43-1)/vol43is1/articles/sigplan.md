In recent years, interactive theorem proving has revealed unexpected potential, both enhancing collaboration among professional mathematicians and making the field accessible to software engineers and those from less traditional academic backgrounds.

Many of the benefits of mathematicians adopting such technologies are obvious - digitizing a library of theorems would open it up to search and other automotive tools, which could then be used to assist in the building of more complicated modern proofs. Should we reach the point where modern research level proofs are built with or at least checked by a theorem prover, ensuring correctness would no longer be a matter of faith in the author or in the wait for peer review. 

The technology is still in its infancy in adoption by the larger mathematical community, in part since to get a proof to make sense to a computer requires consideration of many smaller details - often hand waved away or treated more informally in real life. In turn, the technology is ways off from mathematicians feeling it’s easier to work with proof assistants than without, and therefore worth the opportunity cost to learn. That being said, this comes closer to being a reality the more automation there is and the more mathematics gets digitzed. 

Great strides are already being seen - a library called mathlib for the theorem prover Lean has seen over half the standard undergrad math curriculum programmed into it the last few years (as of writing, it contains 116,770 definitions and 236,001 theorems). Several laborious proofs have also been formally verified, and last year, a notoriously difficult problem - the value of the fifth busy beaver number was proven specifically in the rocq theorem prover. Not just that, but it was done by a group that included many non-mathematicians. 

## Background

The busy beaver function is one which gives deep insights into computability, as the nth busy beaver is the maximum number of steps a machine with n rules can take before halting. This means if you know the nth busy beaver and your program runs for longer than that, that program is guaranteed to run forever. At first glance, this might suggest a workaround to the famously uncomputable halting problem, until one learns that this function too is uncomputable. Uncomputable here means that there cannot exist any algorithm that can take any input and spit out the corresponding output, and it shows up constantly in the theory of computation to remind us of the expressive power and limitations of what computers can and can’t do. Therefore, it is not even a given that we’ll always be able to find the next busy beaver number, and the difficulty certainly explodes to a tremendous degree with each value that has been found. 

With BB(1), there are only two possible simple cases one need look at, whereas with BB(2), there are over 6000. That said, automation can quickly be used to prove its value is 6. With 3 rules, there are millions of possible machines, and billions for 4. At the very least for 2 and 3 rule machines there are few endlessly looping machines - once one arrives at 4 the number spikes to thousands. Still, through meticulous case analysis the 4th busy beaver was eventually identified at 107 - and as a testament to its progressive difficulty, the 5th busy beaver in turn has eluded researchers for the last 40 years. 

The result was finally obtained at 47,176,870. What’s more amazing is that this result, conjectured by professional mathematicians, ultimately was found by an online community who was working to verify their partial results in rocq. That group that had grown to around 20 researchers featured many from non-traditional academic backgrounds outside the mathematical community. The final proof itself was found and formalized in 40,000 lines in rocq by an anonymous discord user named mxdys - whose background very little is known about.

Developments like these show it’s an exciting time for interactive theorem provers. They demonstrate the possibility that anyone, professional or not, might be able to collaborate on theorems as a legitimate possibility in the near future - an exciting possibility!
